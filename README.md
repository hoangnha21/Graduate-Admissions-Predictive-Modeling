# Graduate-Admissions-Predictive-Modeling

## A. Contexts

Department of Business Recruitment is responsible for developing and executing a recruiting
strategy to recruit highly qualified individuals for graduate and doctoral programs in the UIC
College of Business Administration (CBA). The scope is to increase applications and to grow
enrollments in the programs offered by the UIC Business Liautaud Graduate School.

The department has recently faced challenges when confronting the massive volume of
student applications. There is a significant demand to study and analyze recent historical
trends to predict what steps need to be taken for impending changes.

The department needs to get a fairly accurate insight into the volume of expected incoming
students each term. Also, being able to provide an informative and interactive visualization
of the student enrollment data will help recruiters make valuable data-driven decisions.

## B. Objectives

•The department has requested a business analyst to assist with the statistical and data
analyses of key enrollment and admission metrics. Besides, there is an increased demand for
the creation of interactive enrollment dashboards, and user-friendly admissions comparison
reports, which enable real-time access to relevant enrollment indicators.

## C. High-Level Scope

• Deploy predictive machine learning models that aid with the forecast of the enrollment
and admission rates based on historical student admissions data obtained through the
Slate CRM university platform. These models may help make an accurate prediction
regarding each prospective student’s intent-to-enroll (ITE) decision.

• Create interactive enrollment dashboards for visualizing weekly enrollment reports with
Tableau. These dashboards provide real-time access to enrollment metrics and allow
stakeholders to extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions. 

• Leverage the capabilities of the Slate tool to develop user-friendly custom reports that
provide insights into applicant trends, yield rates, conversion rates, and other relevant
enrollment metrics.
